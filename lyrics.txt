One, one, one, one, one
Talkin in my sleep at night, makin myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin it would save me
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesnt love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One: Dont pick up the phone
You know hes only callin cause hes drunk and alone
Two: Dont let him in
Youll have to kick him out again
Three: Dont be his friend
You know youre gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if youre under him, you aint gettin over him
I got new rules, I count em
I got new rules, I count em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count em
I gotta tell them to myself
I keep pushin forwards, but he keeps pullin me backwards
Now Im standin back from it, I finally see the pattern
But my love, he doesnt love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do
One: Dont pick up the phone
You know hes only callin cause hes drunk and alone
Two: Dont let him in
Youll have to kick him out again
Three: Dont be his friend

And if youre under him, you aint gettin over him
I got new rules, I count em
I got new rules, I count em

Practice makes perfect
Im still tryna learn it by heart 
Eat, sleep, and breathe it

Dont, dont, dont, dont
Youre gettin over himIt was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldnt stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now were picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels
All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Its like we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely, ooh, ooh, ooh
Even when we know its wrong
And somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight cause were scared to be lonely
Even when we know its wrong
And somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight cause were scared to be lonely
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely, ooh, ooh
Eh, eh, scared to be lonelyIf you dont wanna see me
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
Im all good already
So moved on, its scary
Im not where you left me at all, so
If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Dont show up, dont come out
Dont start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Dont start caring about me now
Arent you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word goodbye?
Though it took some time to survive you
Im better on the other side
Im all good already
So moved on, its scary
Im not where you left me at all, so
If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Dont show up, dont come out
Dont start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Dont start caring about me now 
Up, up
Dont come out, out, out
Dont show up, up, up
Dont start now 
Up, up
Dont come out, out

If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Dont show up , dont come out 
Dont start caring about me now 
Walk away , you know how 
Dont start caring about me now

Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now Im falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
Im indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope Im not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
Its you in my reflection
Im afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I wouldve known it, baby
I wouldve stayed at home
Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, Hello
I knew that was the end of it all
I shouldve stayed at home
Cause now there aint no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, Hello
I knew that was the end of it all
I shouldve stayed at home
Cause now there aint no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
Its you in my reflection
Im afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I wouldve known it, baby

아직 너를
못 떠나고 뭘 하고 있는 건지
언젠가는 다 끝날 걸

마지막은 없어

Otra baby me escribe, nunca le respondo 
La vida da vuelta y el mundo es redondo
Y yo voy a que te beso de nuevo en London
O si no en Marbella 
Encima de la arena viendo la estrella 
Yo sé que ni la ola han borrao mi huella 
Pero tu pichaera e lo que me atropella
Sol, playa y en la arena, vamo allá 
Baby, no te quede callá
Yo sé que tú quiere guayar conmigo
Otra vez me tienes en depresión
Fumando en la habitación, eh
Pero yo sé que
One day youll love me again

Come on, phy-phy-phy-physicalIm on an island, even when youre close
Cant take the silence, Id rather be alone
I think its pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
Its time I wave goodbye from the window
Lets end this like we should and say were good
Were not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So lets at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when youre with somebody else
As long as you swear you wont be pissed when I do it myself
Lets end it like we should and say were good
No need to hide it, go get what you want
This wont be a burden if we both dont hold a grudge
I think its pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
Its time I wave goodbye from the window
Lets end this like we should and say were good
Were not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So lets at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when youre with somebody else
As long as you swear you wont be pissed when I do it myself
Lets end it like we should and say were good
Now youre holding this against me like I knew you would
Im trying my best to make this easy
So dont give me that look, just say were good
Were not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So lets at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when youre with somebody else
As long as you swear you wont be pissed when I do it myself
Lets end it like we should and say were goodHere, where the skys falling
Im covered in blue
Im running and Im crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?
And I know I go all in, but why do I?
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
Its a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and Im leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you
Theres a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over that watch over you
When Im walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
Its a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and Im leaving

Your face on my ceiling, I fantasize
Oh, I cant control it, I cant control it

As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol

I never thought Id hear my heart beat so loud
I cant believe theres something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heavens right here, baby
Touch me, so I know Im not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
Id rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heavens right here, baby
Touch me, so I know Im not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
I cant believe, I cant believe
I finally found someone
Ill sink my teeth in disbelief
Cause youre the one that I want
I cant believe, I cant believe
Im not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought Id hear my heart beat so loud
I cant believe theres something left in my chest anymore
Oh, goddamn, you got me in love again
I cant believe, I cant believe
I finally found someone
Ill sink my teeth in disbelief
Cause youre the one that I want
I cant believe theres something left inside my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again 
AgainIts second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when theres boys around
Isnt it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When theres nothing funny here? 
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we wont freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it dont go south
But theres nothing funny now 
When will we stop saying things
Cause theyre all listening?
No, the kids aint alright
Oh, and they do what they see
Cause its all on TV
Oh, the kids aint alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Im sure if theres something that I cant find the words to say
I know that there will be a man around to save the day
And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained
I shouldve stuck to ballet 
When will we stop saying things
Cause theyre all listening?
No, the kids aint alright
Oh, and they do what they see
Cause its all on TV
Oh, the kids aint alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
If youre offended by this song
Youre clearly doing something wrong
If youre offended by this song
Then youre probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
When will we stop saying things
Cause theyre all listening?
No, the kids aint alright
Oh, and they do what they see
Cause its all on TV
Oh, the kids aint alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane wont save me
Ive been working later, Ive been drinking stronger
Ive been smoking deeper but the memories wont stop
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through
I cant stop thinking bout you
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze wont put my mind at ease
Ive been sleeping later, Ive been breathing stronger
Ive been digging deeper, but the memories wont stop
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through
I cant stop thinking bout you
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before its too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through
I cant stop thinking bout youBefore you came around, I was doin just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I dont pay no mind
And when it came down, I was lookin in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, I can feel it inside
Ive got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
Ive got a fever, so can you check? 
Peut-être quavec du temps, ça partira
Et pourtant, et pourtant, et pourtant, je ne my vois pas
Comme un médicament, moi, je suis rien sans toi
Et je sais quе jessaie, que jе perds du temps dans tes bras
Ive got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
Ive got a fever, so can you check?
Car dans mes yeux, ça se voit 
La fièvre dans les yeux, oui, ça se voit 
Mon cœur se serre, jai du feu dans la voix 
Le plus souvent, cest quand je pense à toi 
Ive got a fever, can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
Ive got a fever, so can you check? 
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now 
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Cause I dont really wanna cool it down 
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now

Car dans mes yeux, ça se voit 
La fièvre dans les yeux, oui, ça se voit 
Mon cœur se serre, jai du feu dans la voix 
Le plus souvent, cest quand je pense à toiIn the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth
For what its worth, I think that He mightve created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night
Ive been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights dont mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
Im sorry, so sorry
Im sorry, yeah
I need your love
And Im dying for the rush
Cause my heart aint got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that its not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, Ive got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?
Dont matter whats written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition tells me that Im doing you wrong
If I dont come home
Just say you forgive me and dont let me go
Ive been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights dont mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
Im sorry, so sorry
Im sorry, yeah
I need your love
And Im dying for the rush
Cause my heart aint got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that its not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?

Til the sun starts rising
I need your love
And Im dying for the rush
Cause my heart aint got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that its not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?

You love to disappoint me, dont ya?
You tell me what I want, but aint no follow through
You dont follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but
Ive been thinking itd be better
If we didnt know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking itd be better
If we didnt stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
I know its really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head

I know its really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, thats what makes us good in bed

We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think thats what makes us good in bed
I dedicate this verse to 
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
Thats what we do, yeah 
You always let me down, boy 
But when youre going down, I get so up 
Dont know if I can find someone who do me like you do
Ive been thinking itd be better
If we didnt know each other 
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking itd be better
If we didnt stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

Youve been telling me some lies, I be thinking its the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do
I dont wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I aint satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore
And Ive been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And Ive been far, and Ive been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
Even though Ive run away, I still come back
No, theres nothing more to say, its all been said
Ive been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that Ive gone mad
I dont wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I aint satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore
And Ive been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me

Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love

If were not getting on, getting on?
Can we just let it go?
Cause were waiting for a miracle
Why wait for a miracle? Yeah
And Ive been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And Ive been far, and Ive been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love

New love, new loveFatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin
But Im ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when Im far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
Youre the only thing I know
And I dont wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like Im at home
Cant wait til were alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin nothin back
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance
My heart wide open
Fallin in and out of focus
Pressure flowin like a river in my head
Crying you aint with me and its floodin the whole city
While my souls burnin like a cigarette
Youre the only thing I know
And I dont wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like Im at home
Cant wait til were alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand

Like its our last dance

We can smile and wave, and itll be okay
Maybe one day, itll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?

So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Used to walk around your apartment
Nothing but a smile on me
But tonight Im so self conscious
Isnt it so clear to see?
Nothings ever perfect in Paradise
Dont know what its worth til you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know
But it’s hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
Cause we dont believe in this Garden of Eden
This Garden of Eden?
I have cried for you, and Ill ride for you
I would die for you, but would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?

He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
Bang bang

He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play
Bang bang
I shot you down
Bang bang
You hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
I used to shoot you down
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang

Counting up the stacks on the counter, a fucking disease
Dont ask me to be righteous if you practise what you teach
Counting all your blessings the second youre down on your knees
So why, why
Dont we get a little high, high?
Dont we get a little, get a little
Dont we get a little high
Get a little high, high
Keep my head under the water, pride buried in my chest
Not counting all the minutes, the seconds, not holdin my breath
Now sinking from the surface, swimming in my lungs
Losing all my vision, religion, Im holding my tongue
So why, why
Dont we get a little high, high?
Dont we get a little, get a little
Dont we get a little high
Get a little high, high
Dont wanna pay attention to the writing on the wall
Painted with aggression, and dripping when you call
Not gonna learn my lesson, am I running out of time?
So, why, why, why?
Dont we get a little, get a little
Dont we get a little high
Get a little high, highUp and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, youll come tumblin down
Karmas got a kiss for you
Why are you blamin me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the door
Slammed shut on me
Somethin a little bit bitter that shouldve been sweet

Hopin I wont eat
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, youll come tumblin down

Theres room for two
You shouldve never done somethin like that to someone
You cant undo

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, youll come tumblin down
Karmas got a kiss for you

If only we could turn back time
Back to the day we said goodbye
Maybe your heart would still be mine
My love, if only
Don’t they say when you find love
Keep it close, treasure it like the sunset
Like something more than gold
And Did we almost know it
Did we almost have it all
Before we let go
If only we could turn back time
Take back the day we said goodbye
Maybe your heart would still be mine
My love, if only
Ancora si la vita è
Sopra di noi, se sei con me
Maybe your heart would still be mine
My love, if only
Maybe your heart would still be mine

When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptations strong
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you 
Some things lookin better, baby
Just passin through 
And I think its gonna be a long, long time
Til touchdown brings me round again to find
Im not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have ever said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you 
Some things lookin better, baby
Just passin through 
And I think its gonna be a long, long time
Til touchdown brings me round again to find
Im not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no 
And this is what I should have ever said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in
Cold, cold heart 
Hardened by you
Some things lookin better, baby 
Just passin through 
And I think its gonna be a long, long time
Til touchdown brings me round again to find
Im not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no 
And this is what I should have ever said 
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in 
Shoorah 
Shoorah
Shoorah 
ShoorahOne look was enough, enough for me
The whole room stops
And its not me to be one, to be one
One of many
Cause its a hundred others speaking
Ive been tryna make a step
A hundred others speaking
I cant make you understand
Theres only one out here for ya, one out here for ya
Ill be the first to say, Baby, whats your name?
Cause I want ya, that kind of woman
Hard to pretend, now I cant sit still, let me show ya
That kind of woman 
Hard to pretend, now I cant sit still any longer
That kind of woman
Ill pick you from the crowd
Dont come to me
I want you to myself
No, I wont be, wont be one
Wont be one, one of many
Cause its a hundred others speaking
Ive been tryna make a step
A hundred others speaking
I cant make you understand
Theres only one out here for ya, one out here for ya
Ill be the first to say, Baby, whats your name?
Cause I want ya, that kind of woman
Hard to pretend, now I cant sit still, let me show ya
That kind of woman 
Hard to pretend, now I cant sit still any longer
That kind of woman
 Keep you close, next to me, I wont let you go
 Reminisce that you once met a girl like this
The first to say, Baby, whats your name?
Cause I want ya 
Ill be the first to say, Baby, whats your name?
Cause I want ya, that kind of woman 
Hard to pretend, now I cant sit still any longer
That kind of womanYou and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I cant believe you let me down
But the truths in the way it hurts
For months on end Ive had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here
You say Im crazy
Cause you dont think I know what youve done
But when you call me baby
I know Im not the only one
Youve been so unavailable
And sadly, I know why
Your heart is unattainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine
You say Im crazy
Cause you dont think I know what youve done
But when you call me baby
I know Im not the only one
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
Youve made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up
You say Im crazy
Cause you dont think I know what youve done
But when you call me baby
I know Im not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
I know Im not the only one
I know Im not the only one
I know Im not the only oneI, Im a one way motorway
Im the one that drives away, then follows you back home
And I, Im a street light shinin
Im a wild light blinding bright, burning off alone, oh-oh-oh
Its times like these you learn to live again
Its times like these we give and give again
Its times like these you learn to love again
Its times like these, time and time again, oh-oh-oh
I, Im a new day rising
Im a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight
I, I am a little divided
Do I stay or run away and leave it all behind?
I know
Its times like these you learn to live again
Its times like these you give and give again
Its times like these you learn to love again
Its times like these, time and time again 
Lets go, its times like these that we activate
Do something to improve, dont procrastinate 
I been cooking now, make a wicked pasta plate
Stream games at 11 but I clap at eight 
And Ill drink on FaceTime if you tempt me
Time to pay back all the health docs lent me 
And for me West 10s elementary
But right now I wanna see Ladbroke Grove empty, you get me?
We make it better together well make a better life
Because the pressure is ever upon us every night
And everyday so we pray and we will forever fight
Well make it better together, well make a better life
I, Im a one way motorway
Im the one that drives away, then follows you back home, mm-mm-hm
I, Im a street light shining 
Im a wild light blinding bright, burnin off alone
Its times like these you learn to live again
Its times like these you give and give again
Its times like these you learn to love again
Its times like these time and time again
Its times like these you learn to live again
Its times like these you learn to love againWoohoo

What would you feel?
What would you feel if I took over the fake and made them all real?
What would you say?
What would you say if I told you its actually gon be a good day?
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe its because youre running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
What do you need?
What do you need to show you theres better things to life than good weed?
What do you hear?
What do you hear?
What do you hear when I tell you Im always near?
I made it pretty clear
What do you see?
What do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free?
You got a friend in me
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe its because youre running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
And Im still here
And Im holding hard onto your hand
But it still feels
Like youre never gonna understand
One can drown alone, but we can swim together
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
And let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Is it because youre running low on gear?
Maybe God does answer all your prayersI see the lights
Dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin, to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin
I can be your muse, I can be your ally
I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I dont wanna preach, but I’m all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
Theres a fire
Rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song
The one that played while I was layin in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms, ’cause
I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I dont wanna preach, but Im all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
Lo-oh-oh-ove

They say love is religion 
So say a prayer with me
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees 
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

But long as you have faith in me
Well have ourselvesIm on an island, even when youre close
Cant take the silence, Id rather be alone
I think its pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
Its time I wave goodbye from the window
Lets end this like we should and say were good
Were not meant to be, thats never gonna change
So lets at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when youre with somebody еlse
As long as you swear you wont be pissеd when I do it myself
Lets end it like we should and say were good
No need to hide it, go get what you want
This wont be a burden if we both dont hold a grudge
I think its pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
Its time I wave goodbye from the window
Lets end this like we should and say were good
Were not meant to be, thats never gonna change
So lets at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when youre with somebody else
As long as you swear you wont be pissed when I do it myself
Lets end it like we should and say were good
Now youre holding this against me like I knew you would
Im trying my best to make this easy
So dont give me that, just say were good
Were not meant to be, thats never gonna change
So lets at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when youre with somebody else
As long as you swear you wont be pissed when I do it myself
Lets end it like we should and say were goodOoh, ooh
Baby, Ive been feedin the addiction
Flyin from there and back, felt like an acrobat
Blue eyed, so I fell into submission
Needed to catch myself, like what the hell?

I want somebody to love me
Whyd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobodys gonna save my life
Ladies and gentleman
Dua Lipa!
We are wicked men
Looking for buckles to loosen
By the Count of 10
I wanna see somebody human
And I lost what it was
In the clear blue dust
Of a Downtown Romeo
In a couple of weeks
You can tell all the freaks
How you carried my body home
But tonight I crossed the line
Dear Mr. Lonely
How much could you know me?
I could find lessons in light
But once youve earned it
Youve already burned it
I dont wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
Whyd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobodys gonna save my life
Woo!
Got my ticket man and Im looking
For somebody to use it
I know we pretend
But one of these days
Were gonna lose it
And I once left town
When the leaves turned brown
With a couple of souvenirs
She was in my car
When we hit that wall
Yeah it couldve move me to tears
But tonight I crossed the line
I used to know her
When my house was sober
I could find lessons in light
But once its over, its all really over
I dont wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
Whyd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobodys gonna save my life
But tonight I crossed the line
I used to know her
When my house was sober
I could find lessons in light
Over and over, is it really over?
I dont wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
Whyd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobodys gonna save my lifeI say
I’m free
To do what I want
Any old time
I say
Love me, hold me
Love me, hold me
‘Cause I’m free
To do what I want
Any old timeGimme release
Keep the drugs
Gimme relief
Keep the love, just gimme a piece of that
One piece of that
Give it to me
Don’t judge, just give it to me
No heart, no second degree tonight
Run free tonight
I won’t stop
Not now
Guess what?
Hella, hella, it’s my body right
I go in light
Hella, hella, it’s my body
I’ll dance if I want to
Hella, hella, it’s my body
Hella, hella, it’s my body
Some people do
But some, they just like to talk 
Some shoot the breeze
But some like to leave a mark 
Some need the light
And some people like the dark 
I won’t stop
Not now
Guess what?
Hella, hella, it’s my body right
I go in light
Hella, hella, it’s my body
I’ll dance if I want to
Hella, hella, it’s my body
Hella, hella, it’s my body
Dont cry for us
No time for us
When were at some party
When you grab somebody
Dont cry for us
No time for us
When were at some party
When you grab somebody
I’ll dance if I want to
My body, my body, my body
Hella, hella, it’s my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Hella, hella, its my body
My body, my body, my body
Hella, hella, its my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Hella, hella, its my bodyIt was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldnt stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now were picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels
All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo
Even when we know its wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight cause were scared to be lonely
Even when we know its wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight cause were scared to be lonely
Is it just our bodies?

Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?

Cause were scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo

Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo
Eh, eh, scared to be lonelyI bet were higher than the people on cloud nine
This connection got me feeling like
Ive known you my whole life, wow
Even our shadows know each other in the light
So I do, I think of losing you
And youre right by my side, huh
Im not really thinking clear
Too good to be true
And thats what I feel
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I cant explain
We get lost creeping up
So baby dont you let go 
The thought of you with someone kills me
Ill be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it aint me
And baby if you ever 
Find another lover, youll see
Ill be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it aint me
I got a little devil dancing in my mind
Playing tricks with my imagination
Ruining my night, well
I try to shake it off by looking in your eyes
All the voices in my head keep tryna
Tell me its goodbye, uh
Im not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and thats what I fear
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I cant explain
We get lost creeping up
So baby dont you let go 
The thought of you with someone kills me
Ill be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it aint me
And baby if you ever 
Find another lover, youll see
Ill be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it aint me
So baby dont you let go
Im not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and thats what I feel
Like what if you left me here
Like what if you left me here
And I feel the floor with my sequin tears
So baby dont you let go 
The thought of you with someone kills me
Ill be dancing with my heart broke 
Such a sad disco , if it aint me
And baby if you ever 
Find another lover, youll see 
Ill be dancing with my heart broke 
Such a sad disco , if it aint meEvery breath that Im takin, every step that Im makin
Aint no way I can run without you
Every ghost in my past life held my hand when I crashed down
Carries me when I wanna break through
We all die, but right now I feel like livin
And we all cry, but right now Im not gonna give in
When we collide I know I can do anything
Cause I got ya, and you got me
 Can they hear us?
Blame it on my mind, blame it on delirious
We all die, but right now I feel like livin
Can they hear us? Can they hear us? 
Anywhere that I turn to got me goin in circles
No matter what, Ill make sure we get out
Cause we all die, but right now I feel like livin
And we all cry, but right now Im not gonna give in
When we collide I know I can do anything

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think its dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Okie dokie, alchy, keep it low-key like Thor, lil bro
Or hell go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour, Ill ash my lucky
She just yelling Fuck me
Two weeks, shell be yelling, Fuck me
Tonight, she yelling, Fuck me
Two weeks, shell be yelling, Fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheeses pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, yeah, I know you still remember me
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
I will smoke a little something but I dont inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking hows it going
Say the going gets well, go figure, Victors light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows hes a pro, hes a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Let me know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldnt kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, til they cant feel
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they shoulda never made it
Probably been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Were brain dead, take a tug and then pass, then pass
I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted, yeah
I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted

When I put my hands in the air
Look, look, I move like this
When I put my leg up back, forth, back
Look, look, I move like this
When I let my hips sink way, way, down
Look, look, I feel like this
When I flip my hair like up, down, to the middle
Im a rockstar, just a little
Pay attention, grow up
Im educatin 
Good girl when I met your mother
True love one way or another
I feel let down just a little bit
One day we partied, we livin
The next Im down in my feelings
So hurt, my heart is a-bleeding
Why, why dont you love me?
Why, why dont you love me?
Why, why dont you lovе me?
Anymore, anymore?

Or Im not listenin, or Im indifferent
Truly I aint got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who dont even care about my well-being
I dont dance, dont ask
I dont need a boyfriend
So you can go back
Please enjoy your party, Ill be here
Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy whos hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I dont listen to, and I dont wanna get with you
So tell my friends that Ill be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I cant wait til we can break up outta here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I dont mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions arent to bother me
But honestly Id rather be somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to some music with a message, like we usually do
And well discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope youll understand that Ill be her
Not there in the kitchen with the girl whos always gossiping about her friends
So tell them Ill be here
Right next to the boy whos throwin up cause he cant take whats in his cup no more
Oh, God, why am I here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I cant wait til we can break up outta here
Hours later, congregatin next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin bout her haters, she aint got none
How did it ever come to this?
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, Ill be in the car when youre done
Im stand-offish
Dont want what youre offerin
And Im done talkin
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when theyre ready that Im ready
And Im standin at the TV with my beanie low
Yo, Ill be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Ask myself, what am I doin here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Hmm
Oh-oh-oh here, here
Hmm
Here, here
Are we over here?Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
And I will sing a lullaby
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way

Major mistake
No, I never shoulda gone, baby, I was on the run
On the run
It was heartbreak
I cant stand another day knowing that you are the one

Eh-eh-eh-eh
Hold my hand
Take a risk til it all falls down
Is it a sin to commit?
If so, help me now
Whats a day without a kiss?
Can we live out loud?
All we ever do is night time lately
Ive been waiting for a lifetime for too long
Ive been waiting for the right time, baby
I wanna be yours 
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours 
Are you lookin at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
 yours

I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Feel the rush when we touch
Electricity
Feel the heat, light me up
One hundred degrees
This is more than the crush
It was meant to be
All we ever do is night time lately
Ive been waiting for a lifetime for too long
Ive been waiting for the right time, baby
I wanna be yours 
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours

Are you lookin at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
 yourY
 yourY
I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, oohOne, two, three...
All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret Ive got accustomed to
Once it was so right
We were at our high
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
And knew I hadnt met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I dont know why I got so attached
Its my responsibility
And you dont owe nothing to me but to walk away
I have no capacity
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but Im grown
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
I dont understand
Why do I stress the man when theres so many bigger things at hand?
We coulda never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you
A perspective pushes through
Ill be some next mans other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men
She walks away, the sun goes down
She takes the day, but Im grown
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above, a blaze
I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets
So we are history
The shadow covers me
The sky above, a blaze only lovers see
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but Im grown
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
He walks away, the sun goes down
She takes the day, but Im grown
And in your way, and my deep shade
My tears dry on their own, babe
My tears dry on their ownMmm
Ive been winnin since I left you, left you
And you think you sick, now you bout to get much sicker
Cause Im lookin in the mirror and that ass got thicker
Bacon, baby, heres whats poppin, rich with six-plus figures
Ive been there, Ive been here, I just hustle low and pray
Got a lot up on my plate, takin meetings in LA
Glowin up and blowin up, thats what Im bout to do
When its all been happenin since I left you
You call me all friendly
Tellin me how much you miss me
Thats funny, I guess youve heard my songs
Well, Im too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
Cause if you think I was born yesterday
You have got me wrong
So I cut you off, I dont need your love
Cause I already cried enough
Ive been done, Ive been movin on
Since we said goodbye
I cut you off, I dont need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, Ill tell you why
You say youre sorry, but its too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I dont give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin
You blamed it all on the alcohol, so
I made my decision
Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
Im through, Im done
So I cut you off, I dont need your love
Cause I already cried enough
Ive been done, Ive been movin on
Since we said goodbye
I cut you off, I dont need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, Ill tell you why
You say youre sorry, but its too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I dont give a fuck
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin on your knees
Boy, I dont give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Get up off your knees cause
Boy, I dont give a fuck
How it feel, how it feel, how it feel?
Sign off on our connection, then I sign onto a deal
Shoulda kept it hunnid, man, you shoulda kept it real
Cause I realized you fake and you lost all your appeal
It dont hurt when I see you with her
You was always insecure and believed what you heard
Cause youve seen that all these niggas tryna see when its they turn
But I dont need a cuddle buddy, I just cuddle with my fur
Cut you off, I dont need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, Ill tell you why 
You say youre sorry, but its too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up 
Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I dont give a fuck 
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin on your knees
Boy, I dont give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me 
Get up off your knees cause
Boy, I dont give a fuckIf you were standing on a corner with no money in your pants
And life fell apart, Id hold out on my hand to you
The best and the worse things in life come free
But you can think of me as your best guarantee
Its true, Im here for you
And if you just breathed your last breath
Id give you my air til I had nothing left
Id never let you go
If you were on the edge of a bridge
Id push you to live
Im your parachute, dont you ever forget
And if you get the chance to return the gift
Promise me youll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you wont turn away
Oh, save someone
Like a child underneath the light, afraid of monsters in the night
Ill hold you til the dawn, til theyre gone, no fight for you
Id fight for you
When youre drowing in your tears and no one answers your prays
Ill be the boat to keep you afloat, my dear
And if you get the chance to return the gift
Promise me youll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you wont turn away
Oh, save someone
When youre alone in the darkest nights, Im there for you
When you feel like youre about to cry, Im there for you
I know you got so much strength inside
If I ask you would you save me tonight?
Promise me youll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you wont turn away
Oh, save someoneYou dont know what youve lost til its gone
You cant hear the silence up to this lung
You cant tie heartstrings when theyre left undone
You cant go back when youve left too long
I tried to push us to the very end
I needed a lover more than a friend
But I hit the limit I didnt intend
And I just wanna make amends
Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now Im staring at the emptiness that Ive made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
In the darkness, I hear your voice
Memories of us I feel destroyed
My mind is playing tricks and I have no choice
Without you, my heart makes no noise
Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now Im staring at the emptiness that Ive made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
All I needed was you
All I wanted was you
All I needed was you
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now Im staring at the emptiness that Ive made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, downTalking in my sleep at night, making myself crazy

Now Im standing back from it, I finally see the pattern
But my love, he doesnt love me, so I tell myself, , I tell myself
I do, I do, I do
One: Dont pick up the phone
You know hes only calling cause hes drunk and alone
Two: Dont let him in
Youll have to kick him out again
Three: Dont be his friend
You know youre gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if youre under him, you aint getting over him
Ive got new rules, I count em

Do you ever get the fear that you cant shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that youre in deep?
Ive dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
Cause theres this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee
Do I wanna know?
If this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go
Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
Baby, we both know
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when youve had a few?
Cause I always do
Maybe Im too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now Ive thought it through
Crawling back to you
So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your hearts still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
Im sorry to interrupt, its just Im constantly on the cusp
Of trying to kiss you
I dont know if you feel the same as I do
We could be together if you wanted to
Do I wanna know?
If this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go
Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
Baby, we both know
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when youve had a few?
Cause I always do
Maybe Im too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now Ive thought it throughBaby you should leave this girl alone
But you wont, won’t, wont
But you dont, don’t, dont
Now delete my number from your phone
But you wont-wont-wont
You gotta go, go, go
Oh my, my, my
Gonna spell it right out

But I dont think it’s me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe

I don’t need you to say those words over
Im just telling it like it is
Boy, man up

Et depuis quelque temps nos relations n’sont pas terribles
Pourtant, je te console comme on le voit dans les films
Comment tu veux qu’j’le prenne quand tu m’appelles mon chéri
Alors qu’il y a quelques minutes on était comme sur un ring ?
Et tu sais bien qu’j’aime pas qu’on se prenne la tête devant nos amis
Alors prends ta veste et rejoins-moi tout de suite derrière la son-mai
J’crois qu’il est temps quon récolte tout ce qu’on a semé
Depuis toutes ces années, on s’demandait où ça nous menait
Moi, jai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Et tu voudrais quon se lance
Ton amour, je men lave les mains et tu ten mords les doigts
Oui, jai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Pas moyen que je replonge
Je veux te dire une dernière fois
You say youre sorry, but its too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I dont give a fuck
Tu mamuses, tu accuses
Lalcool, cest ça ton excuse
Est-ce quil y a des filles que ça amuse ?
Mec, tu taccroches, je raccroche
Même quand tes loin, tes tout proche
Le pardon est un don dont je ne me servirai pas
J’espère que le temps te permettra de changer
J’ai tourné la page pour plus tomber
J’espère que le temps te permettra de changer
J’ai tourné la page pour plus tomber
You say youre sorry, but its too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up 
Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I dont give a fuck 
Je me fous de cquelle te dit
Je me fous que ton cœur vrille
Boy, I dont give a fuck
J’espère que le temps te permettra de changer
J’ai tourné la page pour plus tomber
Mais quest-ce que tas pas compris ?

Only thing that keeps me sane
Feeling kind of reckless
Dont you know Im not okay?
I havent found anything strong enough
Days and nights are borderlines without your love
Cruisin at a hundred
It doesnt even feel that fast
Adrenaline is pumping
Kind of hoping that I crash into the water
I would rather drown
Cause anything is better than coming, coming down
I cant get high, I cant get high, I cant get high 
It fucking hurts, these drugs dont work, I dont know why 
Excuse me if I overdose
It happens every time you go
Hard as I try
I cant get high, high, high, high
I cant get high
I dont know why
Have a tab for dinner
It doesnt really work too well
Feeling like a sinner
Goddamn, it hurts like hell
It must be past the point of no return
All this medication only makes it worse
If youve got a remedy, then tell me now
Cause anything is better than coming, coming down
I cant get high, I cant get high, I cant get high 
It fucking hurts, these drugs dont work, I dont know why 
Excuse me if I overdose
It happens every time you go
Hard as I try
I cant get high, high, high, high
I cant get high
I cant get high, I cant get high, I cant get high, I cant
I cant get high, I cant get high, I cant get high
Cause youre the only thing that makes me feel alive
I cant get high, I cant get high, I cant get high 
It fucking hurts, these drugs dont work, I dont know why
Excuse me if I overdose
It happens every time you go
Hard as I try
I cant get high, high, high, highI look in the mirror
All I see is nothing
I look out the window for some peace
But all I find is nothing
Then you take my hand, and suddenly I feel something
Side by side, lying next to you
I feel something
All I need is you to protect me til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears
All I need is you to protect me til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears
Then you take my hand and suddenly, I feel something
Side by side, lying next to you

All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bearsSee, I gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I gotta be outta my head to be still with ya
See, I love you, but I dont like that
I leave, but then I come right back to you
So what is the point? I might as well sit here and roll me a joint
Or pour me a drink
So I can get wasted and dont have to think no more
Get high as a plane
Cause sober, we drive each other insane
And we know if we dont, we gon start fighting again
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Cause the only time we dont fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Lets go
Ive gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And Ive gotta be outta my head to be still with you
See, I love you but I dont like that
Keep leaving, coming right back to you
So I roll me swisher, pour me some liquor before we start to bicker
And calling each other out our names like bitches and n-
Arguing over all that small shit, keeps getting bigger
Corona out the kitchen
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Cause the only time we dont fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Boy, we only get along when we high, oh yeah

One too many at the dive
Saw you called a thousand times
Can’t talk about it, won’t talk about it
Danced until I cried
Took a hit and got too high
Started questioning my life
Let’s not talk about it, won’t talk about it
I’m waking up to messages
Don’t recognize the name
I’m wondering who the F it is
‘Cause I don’t know any Janes
Somebody next to me in my bed
Hold up, wait, this isn’t my bed
Telling myself never again, again
 I don’t know what happened to my friends
 Or where I been
 And I can’t tell you how this story ends
And I can’t pretend
Blame it on the night
One too many at the dive
Saw you called a thousand times

Can’t talk about it, won’t talk about it
How am I in the club again?
Said I was staying in 
Having another heart to heart
With someone that I just met 
And the next thing that I know 
Is I wake up in my clothes 
And the voice inside my head 
Says never again, again
 I don’t know what happened to my friends
 Or where I been 
And I can’t tell you how this story ends
And I can’t pretend 
Blame it on the night
One too many at the dive

You came to me without warning
And I was unprepared
Losing all my intuition, tryna act like I don’t care
I’m so lost in all this madness
So Im throwing up a flare
But you know, baby, I’m a problem
Tryna act like Im not scared
Caught me in ways that I cant explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused
Thought I could handle this tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got slipped away into you
Act of God, don’t know how it started
Now Im boutta lose at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh
I’m lifted, my God
And the ways we move
Like the thing on the hood of my car 
Got me lifted 
Act of God 
Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fire 
Could this be a revelation?
Tell me, is this what I need?
‘Cause all this divine intervention
I’m starting to believe
Is this all an accident, or is this by design?
I know I didn’t ask for it
But now I need it to be mine 
Caught me in ways that I can’t explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused 
Thought I could handle the tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got swept away into you
Act of God, don’t know how it started
No Im boutta lose at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh
I’m scared of the fall
Scared of losing it all, losing my way
It’s my way or nothing
But you give me something I just can’t explain
But then I got lost, lost in you, babe
Got lost in your ways and nothing can save me
Nothing can save me
Act of God, don’t know how it started
No Im boutta lose at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh
I’m lifted, my God
And the ways we move
Like the thing on the hood of my car 
Got me lifted 
Act of God 
Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fireLets go

Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, oohMet a boy and he told me
That life gon burn you out
You can go all four corners of the globe
Still, won’t know what you’re about
You got your issues, your tissues
You cry every night
I’m melodramatic
I guess he was right
Livin out of that suitcase
He said girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon
I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
’Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said ooh
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Another thing that he told me
It’s gonna be a long, long daylight
He’s the one I feel bad for
Don’t have a passion like mine
I’ll keep my issues, my tissues
Keep runnin the lights
I may be impulsive but I do all right
Livin out of my suitcase
He said girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon
I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
’Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said ooh
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
No matter what he said to me
I’m gonna be running free, ooh
I just wanna fly, you see
Ain’t nothing stopping me
Ooh
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
’Cause you know that
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said ooh
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlesslyDrifting away, should I leave and let us break?
Torn, torn apart, left a hole in my heart
I know we might shatter in time, I lost my mind
They say that I should let you go
Tell me I shouldn’t throw
Bricks at my own window
Love in a tornado, bullets in a barrel cage
Roses in a fire, screaming into silence
Diamonds back to coal again
But I wouldnt have it any other
Way, way, way
Staying beside ya, roses in a fire
Stone, stone cold
Only you can warm my soul
Bones turn to dust
Locked away, left untouched
I know we might shatter in time, I lost my mind
They say that I should let you go
Tell me I shouldn’t throw
Bricks at my own window
Love in a tornado, bullets in a barrel cage
Roses in a fire, screaming into silence
Diamonds back to coal again
But I wouldn’t have it any other
Staying beside ya, roses in a fire
Roses in a fire
I know we might shatter in time, I lost my mind
They say that I should let you go
Tell me I shouldn’t throw
Bricks at my own window
Love in a tornado, bullets in a barrel cage
Roses in a fire, screaming into silence
Diamonds back to coal again
But I wouldn’t have it any other
Staying beside ya, roses in a fireWhat a year for dating, crazy
Nothin is the way it was
People textin exes sex pics
From the basement at their moms
If you have human contact
Dont know what youll contract
So your first dates always on Zoom 
You just wish you could just go out
Get a little naughty
Girl, youre drunk on FaceTime
WiFis gettin sloppy
Theres no bars, theres no school
Poundin Claws in a kitty pool
Thirsty slides through DMs
Now you landed in their close friends
No matter how you try to break through
It all feels like a waste of time
When youve gotten your face off Netflix
Hulu, HBO, and Prime
Now youre lookin ready
Though, its low-key scary
Check your drip and grab your Lysol 
If youre ever wanna see another persons body
If you zap on your forehead, youre a total hottie
Wear a mask, wash your hands
Its not like you have other plans
Its awkward, but its cool
Following all these COVID rules 
One: Get in the zone, no more doing edibles at home alone
Two: Stalk their Instagram
Gotta background check if you wanna slam
Three: Up your waxin game
No ones seen you naked since February
And if you hit it off, watch out if they start to cough
I got new rules for dating
Six feet apart, no mating
Masks can be irritating
No more procrastinating
These are the rules for dating
One: Theres a new third base, thats when you get to see their lower face
Two: Right before you touch, Purell until your hands get rough
Three: Just seal the deal, you better hope you lick em when you wake up in the morning
Youre feelin numb, its you, your hand, and OnlyFans
Weve got rules for dating
Safety is stimulating
Its your neighbors youre saving
Youll get that touch youre craving
Just follow these rules for datingOh, oh
While Im laying on your chest
I can feel the emptiness
Like the sound of broken dreams
All those tattoos on your skin
This commitment joining
Tell me are we meant to be
Oh, we used to burn bright
But now Im turning the lights off
You said youd be mine
But Ive been waiting a lifetime
Dont you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Dont mistake my love for weakness
If you think Id run around and round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
Cause its all or nothing, all or nothing
All or nothing
All or nothing
Loving you was like a pill
I stayed cause I liked the thrill
But now were just wasting time 
Ive been waiting weeks all night
You know that were more than friends
Weve been livin in denial
Oh, we used to burn bright
But now Im turning the lights off
You said youd be mine
But Ive been waiting a lifetime
Dont you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Dont mistake my love for weakness
If you think Id run around and round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
Cause its all or nothing, all or nothing
All or nothing
All or nothing
Dont you beg me for forgiveness
Dont mistake my love for weakness
Dont you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Dont mistake my love for weakness
If you think Id run around and round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
Cause its all or nothing, all or nothing
All or nothing
All or nothingSippin on that purple lid
Gangsta boy got me so mean
Come, let’s get a little wilder
Lets wait till the dark gets lighter
Can you spark me up your last cigarette?
I promise you, youll never forget
What feels to be living larger
Baby, party harder
My heart’s never wanted anymore than you yet
When I see those tattoos all over your chest
I want nothing more than to wake in your bed
Next to you, next to you
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one whos never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one whos never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
Ill kiss all the ink on your neck
Cause baby, Im doing it, and you do it the best
Light up, lets get a little louder
Hold me for a little longer
I love it when you whisper in my ear
Tell me things I always wanna hear
Youre the medicine, doctor
Skin on skin, softer
My heart’s never wanted anymore than you yet
When I see those tattoos all over your chest
I want nothing more than to wake in your bed
Next to you, next to you
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who’s never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one whos never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
Let it all down, down, down, down
Let me say hi, hi, hi, hi
Never gonna ground, ground, ground
Never say goodbye, bye, bye, bye
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who’s never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl

I keep dancing here with my eyes closed
Like nothing matters anymore
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that

Make my heart run back and forth
You’re everything I want and more
I think you’re down but I’m not sure
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
Make it hard to talk and see
Im just where I wanna be
Holding you too close to me
You never leave my glass empty
Ooooh, we got nothing
Ooooh, and thats all we wanted
Broken people in the streets
Yet they’re beautiful to see
Everything is incomplete
Yeah, it feels a lot like me
Ooooh, we got nothing
Ooooh, and thats all we wanted
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
I’m way too damaged to go home
I keep dancing here with my eyes closed
Like nothing had to zen me more
And I like that, kinda like that
Make my heart run back and forth
You’re everything I want and more
I think you’re down but I’m not sure
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like thatMoving too fast, they say it won’t last
But I just wanna
Yeah, I just wanna see for myself
The summer days melt, no kiss and no tell
‘Cause I just wanna, yeah, we just wanna
Ooh
I been waiting for you, been waiting for me
A familiar feeling between us
Like we’ve been here before
‘Cause we cant control this familiar feeling between us
We don’t have to say that we’re lovers
Even though we’re touching each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
‘Cause I wanna keep it
Solo where nobody can chime in
We could let ‘em know whеn the time is right
Ooh
For now lets keep it sеcret
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

‘Cause we cant control this familiar feeling between us
We don’t have to say that we’re lovers

‘Cause I wanna keep it
Solo where nobody can chime in

One day we could tell ‘em all
We could tell ‘em how
We could tell ‘em when
We could tell ‘em what
But for now let’s keep it secret
One day we could reminisce
When nobody knew about the way we kiss
And the way we touch
But for now let’s keep it secret
We don’t have to say that we’re lovers
Even though we’re touching each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
‘Cause I wanna keep it
Solo where nobody can chime in
We could let ‘em know when the time is right

Dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin
I can be your muse, I can be your ally
I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I dont wanna preach, but Im all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
They say love is religion
Theres a fire
Rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song
The one that played while I was layin in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms cause
I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can be feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

Im levitatingLyrics from Snippet
Imma hate it when Im picking up you
I just dont wanna breathe the same air
Choking on your smoke
Smashing on your mirrors
Gonna vacate the fake so I see clearer
Running out of ways to love you
Im running out of ways to care
Dont you wear your own mouth?
Walking around and throwing shade
Caught up in your mind games
But did I think youd ever change?
Im running out of ways to love you

Imma hate it when Im picking up you
I just dont wanna breathe the same air
Im running out of ways to love you

Choking on your smoke
Smashing on your mirrors
Gonna vacate the fake so I see clearer
Running out of ways to love you
Im running out of ways to care
And I tried, and I tried, and I tried
But it just doesnt feel right
Like a night, like a night, like a night
With a sunrise

Heavy like the bass-line
Way past “Good Girl” bed time
Had too much, drunk as fuck
Swaying to those red lights
On my worst behavior
Making out with strangers
Dusty buzz, feel the rush
Speeding through my head
I can feel it coming over me
Can you feel it? It’s all over me

Psychedelic candy store

But my love, he doesnt love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do
One: Dont pick up the phone
You know hes only callin cause hes drunk and alone
Two: Dont let him in
Youll have to kick him out again
Three: Dont be his friend
You know youre gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if youre under him, you aint gettin over him
I got new rules, I count em
I got new rules, I count em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count em
I gotta tell them to myself
Practice makes perfect
Im still tryna learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, cause I...

Couldnt hold you long enough in my hands
Cant remember how it went from good to bad
Now I just reminisce, I just reminisce on everything we had
The times you used to call me Baby
Driving in your old Mercedes
That feels like a distant memory now
If I had one chance to tell you how I loved you
Id be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what you meant to me
Im begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
Im begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I never meant for it to end this way 
I wish that I could say this face to face 
Holding on for hope your mind would change 
Cause I want you back 
I need you back to take this pain away 
The times you used to call me Baby
Driving in your old Mercedes
That feels like a distant memory now
If I had one chance to tell you how I loved you
Id be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what you meant to me
Im begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
Im begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
My only request, I wish you the best
But I cant get no sleep, I cant get no rest
My head is a mess, between No and Yes
Right now youre heavy on my mind
I dont wanna guess what youre thinking tonight
I want the facts, I dont want no more lies
I just want a chance to make it right
I just want a chance to make it right
If I had one chance to tell you how I loved you
Id be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what you meant to me
Im begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
Im begging for forgiveness
If only you would listenStand back, stand back
Stand back, stand back
Stand back, stand back
Stand back, stand back
Stand back, stand back 
Stand back, stand back 
Stand back, stand back 
Stand back, stand back 
One look was enough, enough for me
The whole room stops
And its not me to be one, to be one

Dont come to me
I want you to myself

Wont be one

Drawin me in and you kickin me out
Got my head spinnin, no kiddin, I cant pin you down
Whats goin on in that beautiful mind?
Im on your magical mystery ride
And Im so dizzy, dont know what hit me, but Ill be alright
My heads underwater, but Im breathing fine
Youre crazy and Im out of my mind
Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, Ill give my all to you
Youre my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, Im winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when youre crying, youre beautiful, too
The world is beating you down, Im around through every mood
Youre my downfall, youre my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I cant stop singing, its ringing in my head for you
My heads underwater, but Im breathing fine
Youre crazy and Im out of my mind
Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges

Risking it all, though its hard
Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, Ill give my all to you
Youre my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, Im winning
Cause I give you all of me

Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like 
Now Im falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
Im indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope Im not the only one that feels it all 
Are you falling?
Center of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
Its you in my reflection
Im afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I wouldve known it, baby
I wouldve stayed at home
Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, Hello
I knew it was the end of it all
I shouldve stayed at home
Cause now there aint no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, Hello
I knew it was the end of it all
I shouldve stayed at home
Cause now there aint no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time 
Yeah, you got me 
Center of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
Its you in my reflection
Im afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I wouldve known it, baby
I wouldve stayed at home
Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, Hello
I knew it was the end of it all
I shouldve stayed at home

Oh no, cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, Hello
I knew it was the end of it all
I shouldve stayed at home
Cause now there aint no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
You break my heart and I am
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I wouldve stayed at home
Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, Hello
I knew it was the end of it all
I shouldve stayed at home
Cause now there aint no letting you go

Cause now there aint no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?Before you came around, I was doin just fine
تا قبل از اینکه تو بیای دور و برم، من حالم خیلی خوب بود
And when it came down, I was lookin in your eyes
معمولا، معمولا، معمولا اهمیتی نمیدم
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, I can feel it inside
و وقتیکه دچارش شدم، داشتم به چشمهای تو نگاه میکردم
Ive got a fever, so can you check?
من تب دارم، میتونی چک کنی؟
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
دستت رو بذار روی پیشونیم، گردنم رو ببوس
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
عزیزم وقتیکه لمسم میکنی، از خجالت سرخ میشم
Ive got a fever, so can you check? 
من تب دارم، میتونی چک کنی؟
Peut-être quavec du temps, ça partira
شاید به مرور زمان از بین بره
Et pourtant, et pourtant, et pourtant, je ne my vois pas
و هنوزم، هنوزم، هنوزم نمیتونم خودم رو اونجا ببینم
Comme un médicament, moi, je suis rien sans toi
تو مثل دارویی و من بی تو هیچم
Et je sais que jessaie, que je perds du temps dans tes bras
میدونم که دارم سعی میکنم، و میدونم که توی آغوشت زمان فراموشم میشه
Ive got a fever, so can you check?
من تب دارم، میتونی چک کنی؟
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
دستت رو بذار روی پیشونیم، گردنم رو ببوس
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
عزیزم وقتیکه لمسم میکنی، از خجالت سرخ میشم
Ive got a fever, so can you check?
من تب دارم، میتونی چک کنی؟
Car dans mes yeux, ça se voit 
چونکه از چشمهام پیداست
La fièvre dans les yeux, oui, ça se voit 
تب توی چشمهام، آره پیداست
Mon cœur se serre, jai du feu dans la voix 
قلبم داره غرق میشه، صدام گر گرفته
Le plus souvent, cest quand je pense à toi 
بیشتر وقتهایی که به تو فکر میکنم اینطوری میشم
Ive got a fever, can you check?
من تب دارم، میتونی چک کنی؟
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
دستت رو بذار روی پیشونیم، گردنم رو ببوس
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red

Ive got a fever, so can you check? 
من تب دارم، میتونی چک کنی؟
Tell me what you wanna do right now
بهم بگو حالا میخوای چیکار کنی
Tell me what you wanna do right now 
بهم بگو حالا میخوای چیکار کنی
Tell me what you wanna do right now
بهم بگو حالا میخوای چیکار کنی
Cause I dont really wanna cool it down 
آخه من واقعا دلم نمیخواد تبم پایین بیاد

بیشتر وقتهایی که به تو فکر میکنم اینطوری میشمMaybe Im miseducated
Lauryn Hill mistaken
Looking up at the sun, so my mind awakens
Im running wild, tryna find the light
Tell me, baby, are you with me or just for the night?
Im hurting, aching
Slowly fading, breaking
The haze is filling my mind, like its medicating
Playing with fire, til our hands are tied
Falling for yous the definition of suicide
Sometimes, we fall in love, fall in love
Falling in addiction
Youre everything they warned me of
If only I had listened
Why do we overkill, overkill, just to feel alive?
A wise man once told me
“Never get high off your own supply”
Never get high off your own supply
Never get high off your own supply
My friends say I have a hundred issues
Guess Im stubborn with you
Ill take it as it comes, as long as Im coming with you
Im ill-behaved, I cant be saved
All the advice I was given, I just threw away
Sometimes, we fall in love, fall in love
Falling in addiction
Youre everything they warned me of
If only I had listened
Why do we overkill, overkill, just to feel alive?
A wise man once told me
“Never get high off your own supply”

Never get high off your own supply

Never get high off your own supply
Mmm 
I can’t feel my face from my mistakes
And all the things I’ve tried to hide
Can’t feel my face, just took one taste
And then we wasted our supply
I can’t feel my face, can’t feel my face
And all the things I, I, I, I can’t feel my face
I can’t feel my face
Sometimes, we fall in love, fall in love
Falling in addiction
Youre everything they warned me of
If only I had listened
Why do we overkill, overkill, just to feel alive?
A wise man once told me
“Never get high off your own supply”

Never get high off your own supply
Never get high off your own supplyIf you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music dont stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If youre feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, Im levitating
The Milky Way, were renegading
I got you, moonlight, youre my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
Im levitating
Im levitating
Chal chale aisi agah aa na pai koi jaha
Show me what you feel inside
Hona hai jo ho jaaye woh keh de mujhei dil
Mujhei karna yu muah sei hide
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way we are
If youre feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, Im levitating
The Milky Way, were renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, youre my starlight
Need you, hold me tight, come on, dance with me
Im levitating
You, moonlight, youre my starlight 
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
Im levitating
Im levitating
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride 
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, Im levitating
The Milky Way, were renegading
Come on, dance with me
Im levitatingEvery night I prayed for, prayed for clarity
All while you were lying right there next to me
You barely even noticed I was losing sleep
You barely even noticed you were losing me, mmm
Dont say shit to me
Dont say a word to me
Dont ask me to change
Dont want your heart to break
Words dont hurt no more
I heard it all before
Dont ask me to change

Or is it just that you dont takе me serious? 
Counting my excuses more than millions 
Boy, Im done with it, done with it, done with it
I dont even know what Im doing here
Dont say shit to me
Dont say a word to me

God created Heaven and Earth
For what its worth, I think that he mightve created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night
Ive been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights dont mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
Im sorry, so sorry
Im sorry, yeah
I need your love
And Im dying for the rush
Cause my heart aint got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that its not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I’ve got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?
Don’t matter what’s written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition tells me that Im doing you wrong
If I dont come home
Just say you forgive me and dont let me go
Ive been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights dont mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
Im sorry, so sorry
Im sorry, yeah
I need your love
And Im dying for the rush
Cause my heart aint got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that its not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I’ve got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?
You know
Ill roar like a lion for you
You know Ill keep trying
Til the sun stops rising
I need your love
And Im dying for the rush
Cause my heart aint got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that its not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, Ive got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldnt stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now were picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels
All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Its like we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Even when we know its wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight cause were scared to be lonely
Even when we know its wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight cause were scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely

Wearing padded bras, sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?

Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, Hello
I knew that was the end of it all
I shouldve stayed at home
Cause now there aint no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
Its you in my reflection
Im afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I wouldve known it, baby
I wouldve stayed at home
Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, Hello
I knew that was the end of it all
I shouldve stayed at home 
Cause now there aint no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, Hello
I knew that was the end of it all
I shouldve stayed at home
Cause now there aint no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I wouldve stayed at home
Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, Hello
I knew that was the end of it all

Cause now there aint no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no , cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, Hello
I knew that was the end of it all
I shouldve stayed at home
Cause now there aint no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?If you dont wanna see me 
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
Im all good already
So moved on, its scary
Im not where you left me at all, so
If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody 
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me 
Dont show up, dont come out
Dont start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Dont start caring about me now
Arent you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word goodbye?
Though it took some time to survive you
Im better on the other side
Im all good already
So moved on, its scary
Im not where you left me at all, so
If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody 
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me 
Dont show up, dont come out
Dont start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Dont start caring about me now 
Up, up

We havent talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
Im scared, Im falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And Im tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this loves important
Dont wanna lose, dont wanna lose you this way
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry

Ive been drinking
Maybe thats, maybe thats why Im feeling
So mistaken
All this love, all this love got me bad
Hallucinating
Every time that youre next to me
Im losing patience
So can we go, can we go all night long?
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time

Take the tension and
Just give a little love and affection
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
I hate the pressure
There wasnt any when I met you
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out

You came to me without warning
And I was unprepared
Losing all my intuition, tryna act like I don’t care
I’m so lost in all this madness
So Im throwing up a flare
But you know, baby, I’m a problem
Tryna act like Im not scared
Caught me in ways that I cant explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused
Thought I could handle this tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got slipped away into you
Act of God, don’t know how it started
No bad flaws at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh
I’m lifted, my God
And the ways we move
Like the thing on the hood of my car 
Got me lifted 
Act of God 
Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fire 
Could this be a revelation?
Tell me, is this what I need?
‘Cause all this divine intervention
I’m starting to believe
Is this all an accident, or is this by design?
I know I didn’t ask for it
But now I need it to be mine 
Caught me in ways that I can’t explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused 
Thought I could handle the tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got slipped away into you
Act of God, don’t know how it started
No bad flaws at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh
I’m scared of the fall
Scared of losing it all, losing my way
It’s my way or nothing
But you give me something I just can’t explain
But then I got lost, lost in you, babe
Got lost in your ways and nothing can save me
Nothing can save me
Act of God, don’t know how it started
No bad flaws at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh
I’m lifted, my God
And the ways we move
Like the thing on the hood of my car 
Got me lifted 
Act of God 
Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fireLook at us lookin out, out the world through glass
While the hands on the clock spin around too fast
Gotta say Ive had enough
Time to live at last
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Lose yourself for a night
Make your own mistakes
Speak the words on your mind
That you never say
Whats a day without a risk?
Do it differently
If youre waiting for the right time, baby
Youll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling nows the right time, baby
Oh, I want it all

Oh, I want it all 
I aint worried bout anybody else because

Boys will be boys, but girls will be women

Its second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when theres boys around
Isnt it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When theres nothing funny here? 
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we wont freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it dont go south
But theres nothing funny now 
When will we stop saying things?
Cause theyre all listening
No, the kids aint alright
Oh, and they do what they see
Cause its all on TV
Oh, the kids aint alright

Thinking bout the way I was

So moved on, its scary
Im not where you left me at all, so
If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody
Dont show up, dont come out
Dont show up, dont come out
Dont show up, dont come out
Dont start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now
Dont start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now
Arent you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word goodbye?
Though it took some time to survivе you
Im better on the othеr side
Im all good already
So moved on, its scary
Im not where you left me at all, so
If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody

Anche se non cè niente da ridere
No, niente da ridere, no
Anche se piove addosso e si scivola
Io so che vorrei essere dove sei tu
Tu
Sento solo questa stupida elettricità
Come voglia di scappare e andare via di qua
Sento solo questa stupida elettricità
Elettricità
Lo sai potrei abituarmi
Potrei abituarmi
E senza stancarmi
Sei tu, sai davvero guardarmi
Nel profondo guardarmi
Senza provare a cambiarmi
E cè sempre qualcosa da risolvere
Ma ci arriverò proprio dove sei tu
Tu
Sento solo questa stupida elettricità
Come voglia di scappare e andare via di qua
Sento solo questa stupida elettricità
Elettricità
Elettricità
Lo sai potrei abituarmi

E senza stancarmi
Sei tu, sai davvero guardarmi
Nel profondo guardarmi
Senza provare a cambiarmi
Potrei abituarmi a te 
Sento solo questa stupida elettricità
Come voglia di scappare e andare via di qua
Sento solo questa stupida elettricità
Elettricità
Lo sai potrei abituarmi
Potrei abituarmi
E senza stancarmi
Sei tu, sai davvero guardarmi
Nel profondo guardarmi
Senza provare a cambiarmi3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane wont save me
Ive been working later, Ive been drinking stronger
Ive been smoking deeper but the memories wont stop
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through
I cant stop thinking bout you

Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze wont put my mind at ease
Ive been sleeping later, Ive been breathing stronger
Ive been digging deeper but the memories wont stop
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before its too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now

Waiting is insane
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through

Hands on each other
Couldnt stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now were picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels
All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Its like we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?-Lief, pretty
-Lief, pretty
Oh, you look so pretty
-Lief, pretty
Put my mind at
-Lief, pretty
Put my mind at
Pretty
Put my mind at
Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasnt gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah 
Hate it when you leave me unattended
Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin wild
Could you help me slow it down?
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

Youre unable to calm down lightly
Youre so intense, yeah you’re so intense
So, you just let me know what youre missing
Come take the pedestal
Youd be the reason why I keep slipping
But come home
You and I, were one too many worlds apart
It really shouldnt work but it does
It really shouldnt work but it does
And side by side, were different but somehow the same
It really shouldnt work but it does
It really shouldn’t work but it does

Hey, go
Woo, yeah

Ah, ah, hey
Ah, ah, ah
Ah 
AhTroubled nights, a troubled guy
With nothing but entitlement behind his eyes
I wish I saw right through the lies
In that disguise, so criminal
Words can cut deep like a knife
And I know that you did it all, all out of spite
You tried to pull me down
When I was ridin’ high, hypocritical
I turned on the light
And I saw exactly who you are
No more tears to cry
From the moment I walked out the door
We fell so far apart, but I swear it was fate
‘Cause you and me together was my greatest mistake
I’m grateful for the pain, nothing left to say
You and me together are better this way
He who comes, he who goes
There’s nothing like a boy with a, a bruisin soul
Who runs their mouth as if he knows
So critical, so critical
I turned on the light
And I saw exactly who you are
No more tears to cry
From the moment I walked out the door
We fell so far apart, but I swear it was fate
‘Cause you and me together
Was my greatest mistake
I’m grateful for the pain, nothing left to say
You and me together are better this way
Times the only reason we decided to stay
We tried to let it go but got stuck in our ways
Were pullin’ on the chain
We were bound to break
You and me together are better this way
Better this way 
Ay, ay, ay
Better this way 
Ay, ay, ay
Better this way 
Ay, ay, ay
You and me together are better this way
You made me better
And knowing what I really want
Knowing who I really am
Ill never settle for nothing less than I deserve
Thank you for the lesson learned
We fell so far apart, but I swear it was fate
‘Cause you and me together
Was my greatest mistake
I’m grateful for the pain, nothing left to say
You and me together are better this way
Times the only reason we decided to stay
We tried to let it go but got stuck in our ways
Were pullin’ on the chain
We were bound to break
You and me together are better this way
Better this way 
Ay, ay, ay
Better this way 
Ay, ay, ay
Better this way 
Ay, ay, ay
You and me together are better this wayIf you dont wanna see me

Cause were scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels
All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Its like we keep coming back for more
Even when we know its wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight cause were scared to be lonely
Even when we know its wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight cause were scared to be lonely
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonelyI told myself Id never let it hurt me”
Been wasting tears on things that don’t deserve me
Blessed with the curse to feel as deeply as I do
I’m compromised and losin’ all my senses
Give me the rush, but easy on the tension
Oh, here it comes, that kind of blue Im so used to
It’s one of those nights
I’m up and can’t get out my mind
So stuck but in the morning
I look in the mirror and tell myself
“Some days are gonna be, gonna be hardеr
Than the rest of them, baby
Than thе rest of them, but it’s alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, cause its alright
I know the taste of when it starts to creep in
Its bittersweet to make it out the deep end
So hard to see its brighter on the other side
Its one of those nights
Im up and cant get out my mind
So stuck but in the morning
I look in the mirror and tell myself
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Than the rest of them, but its alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, cause its alright”
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it’s alright
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, its alright 
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, its alright 
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, its alright 
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Than the rest of them, but its alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, cause its alright
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it’s alright 
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, ‘cause it’s alright
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, its alright
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, its alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, cause its alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, ‘cause it’s alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder.........Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
Im all good already
So moved on, its scary
Im not where you left me at all, so
If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Hurt me with the word goodbye?
Though it took some time to survive you

Cause what if I find nothing at all, nothing at all?
What is the point of my lips if they dont make noise? Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I wont stay quiet, I wont stay quiet
Cause staying silents the same as dying
I wont stay quiet, the flickers burning now
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, its a new life
Real fantasy, wishing it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I wont stay quiet, I wont stay quiet
Cause staying silents the same as dying
I wont stay quiet, the flickers burning now
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, its a new lifeSomewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasnt gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But youre here now, and youre turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind thats fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin wild
Could you help me slow it down?
Put my mind at easе

Would you help me out, please?
Youre locked into Club Future NostalgiaI woke up in your bed
I can’t believe I did it again
Am I still drunk? My head’s a mess
I took you back, this never ends
Last time was the last time
Promise that I’d stay clear
And said “If last time was the last time
How did I end up here? Yeah
Oh, and I know that I should say goodbye
Yeah, oh, and God knows I try, I try, and I try to
Talk myself out of it 
Talk myself out of it 
Talk myself out of it 
Talk myself out of it
Your body speaks, and mine replies
We conversate, our tongues are tied
And yeah I know, we’ll nevеr last
But I can’t leave when you touch likе that
Last time was the last time
Promise that I’d stay clear
And said “If last time was the last time
How did I end up here? Yeah
Oh, and I know that I should say goodbye

I never thought Id hear my heart beat so loud
I cant believe theres something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heavens right here, baby
Touch me, so I know Im not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
Id rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn , you got me in love again
Show me that heavens right here, baby
Touch me, so I know Im not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do

Pretend I dont exist, pretend that I dont
Make you lay awake and wish

You know hes only callin cause hes drunk and alone

If I ever slip, Ill fall into a better situation
So catch up, go put some cheese on it

Lets end it like we should and say were good
Sleeping and cocaine
Sleeping and cocaineIt was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldnt stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now were picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Be lonely
Be lonely
Be lonely
Be lonely

You got me weak 
All through my veins, boy
I can barely sleep 
Adrenaline tornado
On until night-time
Any times the right time
Gimme what I need 
Slice into my cake, boy
Youre the sweetest crush 
Sherbert on my tongue 
One taste aint enough
Its unpredictable
Like a sugar rush 
Lick the buttercup 
One taste aint enough
You get the visual

Piеce of candy joy
You know, you know, you know
Got a sweet tooth, boy

You got the love, the love that I need
Stuck in my mind and stuck in my teeth
You feel so good like cotton candy
Let me just be your favorite, repeat
You got the love, the love that I want
Just gettin started, no Im not done
Give me dessert from your restaurant
Soft on my skin like Yves St. Laurent
Youre the sweetest crush 
Sherbert on my tongue 
One taste aint enough

Lick the buttercup 
One taste aint enough

Thinking bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

So moved on, its scary
Im not where you left me at all, so
If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody, oooh
And if you wanna believe that anything could stop me, yeah
Dont show up, dont come out
Dont start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Dont start caring about me now
Arent you the guy who tried to 
Hurt me with the word goodbye?
Though it took some time to survive you
Im better on the other side
Im all good already 
So moved on, its scary
Im not where you left me at all, so
If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Dont show up, dont come out
Dont start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Dont start caring about me now
Dont show up, dont come out
Dont start caring about me now 
Walk away, you know how
Dont start caring about me now

It gets complicated in my head
In my bed, in my 
And at the parties, nobody seems to care
Its like Im not there
And I just want you to know
One, two
That I still think about it, I still talk about it
And theres not a thing I can do, theres not a thing I can do
I still talk about it, tried to forget about it
And theres not a thing I can do, theres not a thing I can do
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you

Do I come back with the pride that I have left?
Cause I know you were the best
But I just want you to know
One, two
That I still think about it, I still talk about it

Couldnt stand to be far apart
Closer the better

Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?

You hung a cigarette between your purple lips

I hold the Taco Bell and you cried over Eugene

Seein’ you with him burns
I feel it deep in my throat
You put your hands in his shirt
You play him records I showed you
Read him Sylvia Plath, I thought that that was our thing
You know I like you like that
I hate that son of a
 since thirteen
But that dont change the things I feel
Oh, when I see you smile with your teeth at Eugene
Yeah, I can’t deal

Til I can figure it through, figure it through, through, through
Same shitIt was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldnt stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now were picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels
All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Its like we keep coming back for more
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Even when we know its wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight cause were scared to be lonely
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?Broken and focused, not looking for faces
Had no expectations, I was done with all of that
Green eyes, electric, contagious connection
When I least expect it, I forgot it all for that
Im in Heaven when Im where you are 
You see me like no one before 
I dont gotta hide any sides, any sides of myself
Bottle up my feelings, put em up on the shelf
I’ve never been this real with somebody else 
I thought I knew love til thе moment you showed up
In real love, theres no one thats loving better
Theres no compromise cause we see eye to eye
You can tell I collide now
We run together
I cant explain it cause Ive never felt it
What I said, I meant it, and with you
I dont gotta hide any sides, any sides of myself
Bottle up my feelings, put em up on the shelf
Ive never ever been this real with somebody else 
I thought I knew love til the moment you showed up
In real love, theres no one thats loving better
Theres no compromise cause we see eye to eye
You can tell I collide now

Run together, run together 
Run together, run together

I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he cant help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
Im the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where Im coming from, yeah
Its the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
Cause were hot like hell
Does it burn when Im not thеre?
And youre by yourself
Am I thе answer to your prayers?
Im giving you that pleasure heaven
And Ill give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Youre my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
You can’t let me know Im wanted
You can’t let me in your head

But its praise that I get
You aint gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I’m coming from, yeah

Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Pull me, you do me right there

And youre by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
Im giving you that pleasure heaven
And Ill give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hellIts second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when theres boys around
Isnt it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When theres nothing funny here? 
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we wont freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it dont go south
But theres nothing funny now 
When will we stop saying things
Cause theyre all listening?
No, thе kids aint alright
Oh, and they do what they see
Cause its all on TV
Oh, thе kids aint alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Im sure if theres something that I cant find the words to say
I know that there will be a man around to save the day
And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained
I shouldve stuck to ballet 
When will we stop saying things
Cause theyre all listening?
No, the kids aint alright
Oh, and they do what they see
Cause its all on TV
Oh, the kids aint alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
If youre offended by this song
Youre clearly doing something wrong
If youre offended by this song
Then youre probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
When will we stop saying things
Cause theyre all listening?
No, the kids aint alright
Oh, and they do what they see
Cause its all on TV
Oh, the kids aint alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women.......It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldnt stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now were picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely-ly-ly-ly?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels
All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Its like we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely-ly-ly-ly?
Scared to be lonely-ly
To be lo-o-o-nely-ly
To be lo-o-o-nely-ly
To be lo-o-o-nely-lyIf you dont wanna see me
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
Im all good already
So moved on, its scary
Im not where you left me at all, so
If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Dont show up, dont come out
Dont start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Dont start caring about me now
Arent you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word goodbye?
Though it took some time to survive you
Im better on the other side
Im all good already
So moved on, its scary
Im not where you left me at all, so
If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Dont show up , dont come out 
Dont start caring about me now 
Walk away , you know how 
Dont start caring about me now
Dont start now
Im not where you left me at all, so
If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Dont show up, dont come out
Dont start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Dont start caring about me now 
SoDa-ba-da-da-di-da
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Cause now there aint no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
What you, what you gon do
Falling, fallin
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want, want me
Whenever you want it, baby
Its you in my reflection
Im afraid of all the things it could do, do me
If I wouldve known it, baby
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, Hello
I knew that was the end of it all
I shouldve stayed at home
Cause now there aint no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want, want me
Whenever you want it, baby
Its you in my reflection
Im afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I wouldve known it, baby
Break my heart
Break my heart
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
One that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, Hello
I knew that was the end of it all
I shouldve stayed at home
Cause now there aint no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?Before you came around, I was doin just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I dont pay no mind
And when it came down, I was lookin in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly I can feel it inside
Ive got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
Ive got a fever, so can you check? 
Peut-être quavec du temps, ça partira
Et pourtant, et pourtant, et pourtant, je ne my vois pas
Comme un médicament, moi, je suis rien sans toi
Et je sais quе jessaie, que jе perds du temps dans tes bras
Ive got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
Ive got a fever, so can you check?
Car dans mes yeux, ça se voit
La fièvre dans les yeux, oui, ça se voit
Mon cœur se serre, jai du feu dans la voix
Le plus souvent, cest quand je pense à toi
Ive got a fever, can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
Ive got a fever, so can you check?
Car dans mes yeux, ça se voit
La fièvre dans les yeux, oui, ça se voit
Mon cœur se serre, jai du feu dans la voix
Le plus souvent, cest quand je pense à toiI, I cant lie, Im scared to open my eyes
Cause what if I find nothing at all, nothing at all?
What is the point of my lips if they dont make noise? Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I wont stay quiet, I wont stay quiet
Cause staying silents the same as dying
I wont stay quiet, the flickers burning now
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, its a new life
Real fantasy, wishing it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I wont stay quiet, I wont stay quiet
Cause staying silents the same as dying
I wont stay quiet, the flickers burning now
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, its a new life
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily around me
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, its a new life
Its a new life.......Maybe one day, I can see you
We can smile and wave, and itll be okay
Maybe one day, itll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?
For tonight
Lets love like theres no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that its all alright
Why dont we hold еach other, use each othеr, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Lets love like theres no goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
In a dark room
We dont have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though its too late
For tonight
Lets love like theres no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that its all alright 
Why dont we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Lets love like theres no goodbyes 
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
Maybe one day, Ill see you
Just smile and wave and be okay
For tonight
Lets love like theres no goodbyes
For tonight
Pretend that its all alright
Why dont we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight

Walk away..... Sometimes you only find yourself
When youre losing someone else
So I owe it all to youYeah, lets get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, dont ya?
You tell me what I want, but aint no follow through
You dont follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but
Ive been thinking itd be better
If we didnt know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking itd be better
If we didnt stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
I know its really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, thats what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know its really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, thats what makes us good in bed
Its bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think thats what makes us good in bed
I dedicate this verse to
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
Thats what we do, yeah
You always let me down, boy
But when youre going down, I get so up
Dont know if I can find someone who do me like you do
Ive been thinking itd be better
If we didnt know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking itd be better
If we didnt stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
I know its really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, thats what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know its really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, thats what makes us good in bed
Its bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think thats what makes us good in bed
Yeah, we dont know how to talk
But damn, we know how to fu—
I know its really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, thats what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know its really bad, bad, bad
But baby, thats what makes us good in bed
Its bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think thats what makes us good in bed
Its bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think thats what makes us good in bedSo look
There’s a waste of time
Smoke inhale it all
Take the pain off my mind
Im sorry ‘bout the way that I’ve acted lately
I know you just care and you just wanna save me
Trying to enhance the performance of my mind
Taking advice from buried bombs
And this time I may be 
Out of line, I may be 
Out of time, oh my
Oh, the stars I count fall from the sky 
Cause you, youve been my Angel in disguise 
But I just wanna, I just wanna I just wanna
I just wanna roll tonight
So close your eyes and listen
Thеse are my 
Terms and conditions
Ter-terms and conditions
These are my, these are my
Terms and conditions
Ter-terms and conditions
Terms and conditions
Th-these are my, these are my
Terms and conditions
I’e just been exploring, and honesty is boring
If you’re looking for a summary of my life
I tried to do something you thought was incapable
Tried to be someone you think is unchangeable
But who I am has always been the person I am inside
That person is too inescapable
And I know that you had got some things to say
But maybe those things are debatable
So fade the lights to black
And go in the spooky black
Sip from glass
And one of these days maybe I’ll call you back
Oh, the stars I count fall from the sky 
‘Cause you, you’ve been my Angel in disguise 
But I just wanna, I just wanna I just wanna
I just wanna roll tonight
So close your eyes and listen
These are my 
Terms and conditions
Ter-terms and conditions
These are my, these are my
Terms and conditions 
Ter-terms and conditions 
Terms and conditions 
Th-these are my, these are my 
Terms and conditions
Oh, there’s stars that can’t fall from the sky
‘Cause you, you’ve been my Angel in disguise
 But I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna roll tonight
So close your eyes and listen
These are myThis song does not existWoohoo
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride 
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music dont stop for life 
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like 
If youre feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, Im levitating
The Milky Way is liberating

I see it written in the stars
We can go wherever, so lets do it now or never
Baby, nothings ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like were forever every time we get together
No, were never gonna be apart

If we didnt stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
I know its really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head

All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
Thats what we do, yeah 
You always let me down, boy 
But when youre going down, I get so up 
Dont know if I can find someone who do me like you do
Ive been thinking itd be better
If we didnt know each other 
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking itd be better
If we didnt stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist 
I know its really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

Hands on each other
Couldnt stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now were picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like were alright?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight
Cause were scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Yeah, yeah
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels
All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Its like we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason youre holding me tonight

I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought Id hear my heart beat so loud
I cant believe theres something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heavens right here, baby
Touch me, so I know Im not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again

So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
Id rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn , you got me in love again
Show me that heavens right here, baby
Touch me, so I know Im not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do

But look at where I ended up
Im all good already
So moved on, its scary

If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Dont show up, dont come out
Dont start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Dont start caring about me now
Arent you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word goodbye?
Though it took some time to survive you
Im better on the other side
Im all good already
So moved on, its scary
Im not where you left me at all, so
If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Dont show up, dont come out
Dont start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Dont start caring about me now
If you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody
Dont come out
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Dont start now

Sometimes I can cry without pain
Live a life of freedom somewhere
A black raindrop for a sword

And I will cry in the rain
I am a lonely boy
Calling home to you again
I watch the raindrop, and the moon
Pre-Chorus
And what about the sunrise?
Is it over for all concerned?
Chorus
A raindrop with a lovely cap
The steel towers of blue and white
I feel the breeze, see the sea
That day, I gotta think raindrops
Verse 2
What do you range now
When the weather turns pale
And the raindrop is not bright
And the dark is so bleak

The man in the raindrop
Made love to me he said

A raindrop with a lovely cap
The steel towers of blue and white
I feel the breeze, see the sea
That day, I gotta think raindrops

The steel towers of blue and white

I am the only child and I must be free
Hear the cry from the enemy
Tired the sound of the Marching feet

Black raindrop raining down on me
Black raindrop raining down on me
Chorus
And as I pull you in
The raindrop gets a bit brighter
The world gets a bit smaller
I really, really wanna cry

I get a real high when you cry
In the left lane my dear
See the way the little men feel
Back when the raindrop was clear blue
Pre-Chorus
So you fall into the raindrop
Dusty eyes and a turn of the spine
Chorus
And as I pull you in
The raindrop gets a bit brighter
The world gets a bit smaller
I really, really wanna cry

Your only words that made me cry
Of late last night with you, slipped my mind
Chorus
And as I pull you in
The raindrop gets a bit brighter
The world gets a bit smaller
I really, really wanna cry
Verse 1
I cry even when its hurts
I try to stop myself from crying
The earth below and raindrop above
And the one in whom I cling
Pre-Chorus
Cry for the year
Cry for the shame
Chorus
Will stay wrong
Say so long, I cry
Starry lights of the 2015 raindrop
Starry lights of the summer raindrop
Verse 2
She stared into the light
A drunk playing guitar in the kitchen
The window reflects the raindrop
Drifting out into the night
Pre-Chorus
One night, downtown, a girl walked by
Too cold to cry, so she just kept on riding
Chorus
Will stay wrong
Say so long, I cry
Starry lights of the 2015 raindrop
Starry lights of the summer raindrop

Ive been smoking deeper but the memories wont stop
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through
I cant stop thinking bout you
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze wont put my mind at ease
Ive been sleeping later, Ive been breathing stronger
Ive been digging deeper but the memories wont stop
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through
I cant stop thinking bout you
I want you all

3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane wont save me
Ive been working later, Ive been drinking stronger
Ive been smoking deeper, but the memories wont stop
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through
I cant stop thinking bout you
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze wont put my mind at ease
Ive been working later, Ive been breathing stronger
Ive been smoking deeper, but the memories wont stop
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through
I cant stop thinking bout you
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before its too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through
I cant stop thinking bout youAm I running in the right direction
Count everything, I wont be mine
Is this a hard day for perfection
